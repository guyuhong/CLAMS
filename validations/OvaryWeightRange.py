.. module:: OvaryWeightRange

    :synopsis: OvaryWeightRange checks that the gonadosomatic index is
               less than the maximum percentage configured in CLAMS.
               The gonadosomatic index is gonadosomatic index is the
               calculation of the gonad mass as a proportion of the total
               body mass. It is represented by the formula:
               GSI = [gonad weight / total tissue weight] Ã— 100

            The init methods of CLAMS validations are run whenever a new protocol
            or species is selected in the specimen module. Any setup that the
            validation requires should be done here. The three input arguments are:

                db - a reference to the active dbConnection class object
                speciesCode - the species code of the current specimen
                subcategory - the subcategory of the current specimen

            If you need to pass additional data to a validation, you should
            add this data to the species_data table and query it out here in
            the init method (see LengthRange.py for example.)

            The validate method is called when a measurement is made for a specific
            measurement type. Each measurement can have from 0-N validations. When
            a specific measurement is made, say "barcode", all validations
            assigned to the barcode measurement will have their validate methods
            called. Each one should verify that the currentValue is valid based
            on the logic of each particular validation.

                currentValue - the just measured value
                measurements - a list of the measurement types for this
                    protocol, in order.
                values - a list of the stored values of those measurements.
                    In order of the measurements.

            This validation checks if the gonad weight is less than the max
            weight computed as a percentage of the total specimen weight. It is
            a fairly crude check, but still valuable to ensure wildly inaccurate
            measurements.

            This is a fairly simple example, but the validation can be much
            more complex (but usually don't need to be.) Also, remember that
            these run each time a measurement configured for the validation
            runs so you don't want them to take too long to execute as it
            will slow data collection.

            The init methods of CLAMS conditionals are run whenever a new protocol
            or species is selected in the specimen module. Any setup that the
            conditional requires should be done here. The three input arguments are:

                db - a reference to the active dbConnection class object

            If you need to pass additional data to a validation, you should
            add this data to the species_data table and query it out here in
            the init method (see LengthRange.py for example.)

        QObject.__init__(self, None)

    def evaluate(self,   measurements,  values,  result):
        '''
            The evaluate method is called when a measurement is taken to determine
            what changes in the protocol. Each measurement can have from 0-N validations. When
            a specific measurement is made, say "barcode", all validations
            assigned to the barcode measurement will have their validate methods
            called. Each one should verify that the currentValue is valid based
            on the logic of each particular validation.

                measurements - a list of the measurement types for this
                    protocol, in order.
                values - a list of the stored values of those measurements.
                    In order of the measurements.
                result -

            For example, this conditional is for the body count measurement and when
            a count value is logged, it will check to see if that value is greater than 50.

            This is a fairly simple example, but the conditional can be
            more complex (but usually don't need to be.) Also, remember that
            these run each time a measurement configured for the conditional
            runs so you don't want them to take too long to execute as it
            will slow data collection.

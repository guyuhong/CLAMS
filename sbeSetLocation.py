    :synopsis: "This dialog is presented when the user clicks the ""Download""
                button in CLAMSsbeDownloader. This dialog asks the user where
                the SBE was located on the net so that info can be stored in the
                event_data table. Atfter establishing where the SBE was located,
                 the data will then be downloaded from the SBE and inserted into
                 the haul_stream_data table."

This directory contains a couple of tools that can be used to test,
simulate, and log sensor data. Sensor data in this context is (typically)
ASCII based messages generated by devices such as GPS units, temperature
sensors, Gyros, net mesuration systems, etc. that usually output simple
ASCII messages in NMEA0183 format. Example:

$GPRMC,233353.00,A,5734.3624,N,15352.8430,W,0.1,26.0,120324,13.2,E,D*2F<LF><CR>

When working from NOAA vessels, the Scientific Computing System (SCS)
usually logs this data and makes it available on the ship's network. With
SCS versions <= 4 this data was accessed using a simple SCS client which
was part of CLAMS. Starting with SCS 5, this server interface was removed
and the recommendation was to make the data available on the "science"
network using UDP broadcast.


SensorLogger is an application that logs sensor data to disk and also
makes it available to CLAMS using the SCS 4 client interface. This application
is used on vessels that don't have SCS installed. The "SCSVersion"parameter
in the CLAMS APPLICATION_CONFIGURATION table must be set to "4" to ensure
that CLAMS uses the SCS 4 client.


UDP_Sniffer, originally developed to listen for UDP data, can also broadcast
data to simulate the behavior of SCS 5. Since the reception of SCS 5 data on the
science network depends on SCS being properly configured to send data, on the
network switches being configured to allow the data to pass from the mission to
science networks, *and* on Survey "turning on" the output every time SCS is
started there are a number of places this can fail. Using UDP_Sniffer to verify
that the SCS data is available (or not) allows you to quickly determine if
the lack of data is a CLAMS issue, or an issue with SCS 5 or the ships networking
configuration.

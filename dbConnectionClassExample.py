        #  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #
        #  LOOK AT THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE THIS WILL DEFINITELY TRIP YOU UP #
        #  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #

        #  The way that python knows you want to unpack a list into a series
        #  of variables is that you give it multiple variables on the LHS:
        #
        #  x,y,z = [1,2,3]
        #
        #  results in x=1, y=2, and z=3.
        #
        #  But what if your query only returns a single value and you want to
        #  unpack that? Then you use the following syntax:
        #
        #  x, = [1]
        #
        #  results in x=1. You see the comma there? Yes, that's the magic. So
        #  look closely at the example below:

        print('')
        sql = ("SELECT device_id FROM clamsbase2.devices")
        query = self.db.dbQuery(sql)
        for dev_id, in query:                # <------See the comma there?
            print("ID: %s " % (dev_id))


        #  test how dbSelectResults works with an empty query
        print('')
        sql = ("SELECT event_parameter FROM clamsbase2.event_parameters where event_parameter='NO SUCH PARAM'")
        query = self.db.dbQuery(sql)
        for ep in query:
            print(ep)


        #  test how dbSelectResults works when selecting a null entry
        #  Answer: NULLS are returned as None so deal with the accordingly
        print('')
        sql = ("SELECT event_id,comments FROM clamsbase2.samples where ship=157 AND survey=201207 AND event_id=15")
        query = self.db.dbQuery(sql)
        for event_id, comments in query:
            print("ID: %s Comments in here--->%s<---" % (event_id,comments))


        #  ------------------   DATES AND TIMESTAMPS --------------------------
        #
        #  dbConnection sets the Oracle NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT and NLS_DATE_FORMAT
        #  when you open your connection. This ensures a readable and consistent
        #  format is used when querying date/timestamp data.
        #
        #  When using dbQuery/dbQueryResults, all Date type columns are returned
        #  as strings in the following format:
        #
        #        MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS
        #
        #  Date types in Oracle also store time to the second, but if you are
        #  dealing with dates that don't have time, you can truncate the string
        #  or reformat it as needed. To query dates you do not need to do anything
        #  special:

        print('')
        print('Dates:')
        sql = ("SELECT event_id,time_stamp FROM clamsbase2.samples where ship=157 AND survey=201207 AND event_id=15")
        query = self.db.dbQuery(sql)
        for event_id, time_stamp in query:
            print("ID: %s Date type output--->%s<---" % (event_id,time_stamp))

        #  When you want to INSERT dates, you must use the TO_DATE() function to
        #  convert the date string to a Date object the database can store. Note that
        #  you don't have to provide a format string if you provide dates in the
        #  default format as defined above. Here is a ficticious example:

        #sql = ("INSERT INTO nunya.biznass (event_id, time_stamp) VALUES (1, TO_DATE(time_stamp))")
        #self.db.dbExec(sql)

        #  TIMESTAMPS ARE DIFFERENT. Qt treats timestaps as dates and because of this
        #  the fractional seconds are dropped if you don't convert to a string on the
        #  database side. But, since we've set the NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT we don't at
        #  least have to explicitly set the format eact time we call TO_CHAR:
        print('')
        print('Timestamps:')
        sql = ("SELECT event_id,TO_CHAR(time_stamp) FROM clamsbase2.event_stream_data where ship=157 AND survey=201608 "
                "AND time_stamp BETWEEN '6/14/2016 9:19:21' AND '6/14/2016 9:19:23'")
        query = self.db.dbQuery(sql)
        for event_id, time_stamp in query:
            print("ID: %s Timestamp type output--->%s<---" % (event_id,time_stamp))

        #  just like with dates, you must convert your string to a timestamp before
        #  inserting it into the database. Use the TO_TIMESTAMP function like so:

        #sql = ("INSERT INTO nunya.biznass (event_id, time_stamp) VALUES (1, TO_TIMESTAMP(time_stamp))")
        #self.db.dbExec(sql)


        #  RETURNING QUERIES AS DICTIONARIES
        #  sometimes you may not want to iterate through your result set and just
        #  want the data packed in a dicitonary. As of 9/2019 you can set the "asDict"
        #  keyword of dbQuery to return the results in a dictionary. The dictionary
        #  will be keyed by column names and the values will be lists, orderd by row.
        #
        #  Note that the column names will match what is in your SELECT statement.
        #  This means that computed columns will include the function and args. In the
        #  query below, the last column will be "prc_nasc*1.1234"
        #
        #  Also note that when returning a dict, the entire query set is read into
        #  memory. This may cause problems with very large query sets. Use yer brain.

        sql = ("SELECT ship,survey,data_set_id, prc_nasc*1.1234 FROM macebase2.integration_results "
                "WHERE ship=157 AND survey=200909 AND interval=13330")
        data = self.db.dbQuery(sql, asDict=True)

        print('')

        for k in data.keys():
